# Asteroids Console Application game using C++ and OpenGL

This project is an implementation of the classic Asteroids game, designed to enhance my skills as a software engineer by exploring game development concepts and real-time programming in C++. The goal of this software is to create a fully functional game that demonstrates core programming principles, including object-oriented design, collision detection, and user interaction.

The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of C++ by applying it to a creative and interactive application. Through this process, I aim to improve my ability to design, develop, and debug complex systems.
